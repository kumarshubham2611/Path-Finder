# Find The Path Visualization

## A Java GUI that searches for a possible path using algorithms.
Designed and developed a GUI Visualizer with the intent of finding an efficient path-finding algorithm in Java.

Strengthened understanding of pathfinding algorithms such Djikstraâ€™s and A* Search 

Language and Frameworks: Java, Java Swing API
